	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bonfyre-profile/148770.jpg"/>
	<p>After graduating from The University of Illinois, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the creative arts industry. One thing led to another and I ended up working in admissions for a college-prep school. Building relationships with prospective families, marketing an institution with a hefty tuition price tag, and “sealing the deal” with applicants was my daily grind.</p>
	<p>Upon learning about the Startup Institute and the opportunity to work with innovative, early-stage companies, I decided to move back to my home state and immerse myself in the startup world.</p>
	<p>I love indie films, freshly roasted coffee, and am never done seeing the world.</p>
